## My Name is Rebecca Sharkey and I am an undergraduate games programmer. 

#### I am currently finishing my Games Development BSC (Hons) dissertation part-time (On weekends) with The University of Chester aiming to get my full degree by mid 2023, however as all other modules have now been completed I feel as if I have enough knowledge and time to take look for work in this area.
#### My passion is in game mechanics programming, however my course has allowed me to learn about all aspects of games development from programming to 3D modelling and texturing to UX and crucially working in a team environment using various version control softwares.
#### Please explore my GitHub site and pinned repositories to see some of my work so far and get to know more about me.
#### Thank you for your time!
